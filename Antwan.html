<h2>This is my opinion about Playstation and Xbox.</h2>
<h1>Xbox</h1>
<h2>This is the consoles I play on and have lots of fun playing it.</h2>
<h3>Also, I don't hate Playstation; I like all consoles equal. I am a Xbox person, but there are bad things about it that I'll talk about later.</h3>
<h2>The good things about Xbox is there are a lot of games that you can play, but its mostly first person Shooter games and there are quite a few games that are on sale. You can also play old Xbox games on newer Xboxs.</h2>
<h2>The bad things about Xbox is the unnecessary power brick and you have to pay 15 dollars to play online, but you get over 100 games a month! Or you can just pay 10 dollars to play online!</h2>
<h1>Playstation</h1>
<h2>Now for Playstation, I like Playstation but I am a Xbox person! </h2>
<h2>The good things about Playstation is there are a lot of games that you don't have to be online to play!</h2>
<h3>The bad things about Playstation is there are always people that yell at you or say they will hack you or even boot you offline. This gets old.</h3>
