<h1>Welcome to Bold Art</h1>
<h3>Many people might think different about art like what the meaning for it, which kind of art is better, what the benefits of it, or even if they think anyone can become an artists. I wanted to get more people's opinion about art, so I handed out some surveys for students to fill out to let me know what they think of art. I gave them some simple questions which weere: What do you think art is? What type of art do they like most? What do you think are some benefits of art? What do you thik artists think about when they are creating their work? Do you think anyone can be an artist? For the last one I ask them to draw a self portrait or a picture of a friend and they did pretty good.</h3>
<h3>What do you think art is?(your opinion). In my opinion I think art is an creation everyone can love and do. After reading the surveys I can that they have different opinion of what art is for example, someone said that they think "the art without figures that people make so that the world looks full of life", another student said "it's when one person creating things interesting about the world might be painting, sculptures, and more." Even though they have different prespectives of what it means they both got it right because the true meaning of art is "The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power" which is similar to what they said.</h3>

<h5>This painting is  called "The Nightmare" by Henry Fuseli one of the greatest Swiss painter. Henry F. created "The Nightmare" in Detroit Institute of Art in "1781" with oil paint and in the picture you can see a women whose arms are thrown below her while she was deep sleeping with some type of demonic or apelike incubus against her chest. Many might wonder(why is there a horse in the painting as well?) It's because it destabilizes the painting's conceit. According to http://www.visual-art-cork.com "the painting was inspired by a German legends about demons who possessed people as they slept and that the men had gotten a visit from the horses or witches, while the women believed that the occasion was to have sexual intercourse with the devil.</h5>
<h3>What do you think artists think about when they are creating their work? when artists are creating their work I think they are just remebering what the image of what they are trying to paint look like. According to 19/30 students that I interviewed "Artists think about their feelings, emotions, other people, their own experience, how to make their work better, what should they add on their painting or drawing, the world, and other things. They had amazing ideas of what artits think of while creating their work and all them was true in my opinion, the only reason I think the example are true is because when I'm drawing or scretching I think of those things but not all the time sometimes I freestyle my drawing, scretches and painting like most other artistic people.</h3>
